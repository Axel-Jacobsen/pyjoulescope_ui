# Joulescope

Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an inexpensive, precision energy 
analyzer that enables you to build better products.  
Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
For more information on Joulescope, see

This pyjoulescope_ui python package contains the source code for the 
Joulescope graphical user interface that runs on a host PC 
and communicates with the Joulescope device over USB.  This package depends upon
pyjoulescope to communicate with the device. 
This code is written in Python 3.6+.
The code currently runs under Windows 10. 
Linux and Mac OS/X drivers will be before 2019.
